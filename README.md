# 653-todo-app
Preparation for our Morgan Stanley internship for 653 internship course

## Tech stack
The backend is Spring-Boot and the frontend will be React. The database will be mongoDB. The idea is to freshen up our Java and React skills before our internship. 

## The app
A simple todo app where you can: 
- Login
- Register
- Change passowrd
- Delete your account
- Perform CRUD operations for todo's

We also plan to integrate JWT's to protect routes.
